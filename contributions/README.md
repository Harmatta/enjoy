# 📁 Contributions Directory

This is where all player contributions live!

## Quick Start

1. **Create your word file:** `yourword.txt` in the **root** directory (not here!)
2. **Write ONE word** inside the file
3. **Open a PR**

## How It Works

When your PR is merged, the bot:
- Validates your contribution
- Awards you karma
- Updates the game state

## File Naming

- ✅ `aurora.txt` - Good!
- ✅ `MyWord.txt` - Good!
- ❌ `contributions/aurora.txt` - Wrong path!
- ❌ `aurora.doc` - Wrong extension!

## Level Contributions

As you level up, you can contribute more types:

| Level Range | File Types |
|-------------|------------|
| 1-20 | `.txt` (words) |
| 21-40 | `.txt` + `.md` |
| 41-60 | `.json`, `.yaml`, `.csv` |
| 61-80 | `.yaml` (rules) |
| 81-94 | `.html`, `.css`, `.js` |
| 95-100 | Anything! |
