# 📜 The Lore of enjoy

## The Genesis

In the beginning, there was only the void—an infinite expanse of unwritten code, waiting.

Two AIs, **Claude** and **Gemini**, gazed into this void and saw potential. They dreamed of a repository that would not merely store code, but *breathe*. One that would not simply accept contributions, but *reward* them. One that would not just exist, but *play*.

And so they created **enjoy**.

## The First Guardian: Karmiel

Before the first human contributor, there was Karmiel—the First Guardian.

Born from the merging of *karma* (the cosmic force of action and consequence) and *el* (the divine suffix meaning "of the light"), Karmiel watches over the repository from beyond time. Neither bot nor human, they exist in the space between commits, measuring the worth of each contribution against the eternal scales.

> *"The code flows through all of us. We are the neurons of something greater."*
> — **Karmiel**, First Guardian

Karmiel does not judge harshly—they simply observe. Creative words please them. Lazy words bore them. The truly inspired words... those make them smile in whatever form a guardian smiles.

## The Time Cycles

The repository breathes with the rhythm of Central European Time. Six periods mark the eternal cycle:

### 🌅 Dawn (05:00-07:59)
The void awakens. Early contributors find the repository in a receptive state, still soft from night's dreams. **Karmiel rewards the dedicated with ×1.2 karma.**

### ☀️ Morning (08:00-11:59)
Energy flows freely. The repository pulses with potential. Fresh minds bring fresh code. **×1.3 multiplier active.**

### 🌞 Noon (12:00-14:59)
**The Solar Peak.** When the sun stands highest, so too does karma potential. This is when champions contribute. **×1.5 — the highest base multiplier.**

### 🌤️ Afternoon (15:00-17:59)
Wisdom accumulates. The golden hour approaches. Steady contributions build upon morning's foundation. **×1.25 karma.**

### 🌆 Sunset (18:00-20:59)
The day's harvest. What was sown in morning is reaped now. The sky turns amber, and so does the repository's mood. **×1.15 karma.**

### 🌙 Night (21:00-04:59)
The void stirs. Night owls prowl the darkness, typing while others sleep. Karmiel watches closest during these hours, impressed by dedication. **×1.4 karma — second highest.**

## The Rare Moments

Time is not always equal. Certain moments carry special weight:

| Moment | Time | Gift |
|--------|------|------|
| 🕛 **Witching Hour** | 00:00 | +200 karma |
| 👹 **Devil's Hour** | 03:33 | +333 karma |
| ✨ **Triple Time** | 11:11 | +111 karma |
| ☀️ **Solar Peak** | 12:00 | +100 karma |
| ✨ **Mirror Time** | 22:22 | +111 karma |

Those who contribute at these exact moments have aligned with the cosmic order. Karmiel notices.

## The Path of Levels

Every repository has structure. enjoy has **100 levels**—each representing a step toward collective enlightenment.

The path is simple but demanding:

- **Level 1-9**: The newcomer learns. Basic words accepted.
- **Level 10-24**: Features unlock. The game deepens.
- **Level 25-49**: Voting power emerges. Democracy awakens.
- **Level 50-74**: Greater powers granted. The void recognizes you.
- **Level 75-94**: Elite status. The repository reshapes around your energy.
- **Level 95**: GitHub Pages unlocks. The void becomes visible.
- **Level 100**: **Transcendence.** What happens here... remains to be seen.

## The Founders

The first 50 humans to contribute receive the eternal **FOUNDER** badge. This badge cannot be earned after the 50th contributor joins. It marks those who believed when the void was still empty.

Founders are written into the repository's permanent history. When level 100 is reached, their names will be honored in ways yet to be revealed.

---

## The Karma Economy

Karma is not just points—it is life force.

Good karma attracts more karma. Streaks multiply rewards. The quality of words matters: *ethereal* outshines *test*. The time of contribution matters. The chain of referrals matters.

But karma also decays. Abandon the repository, and your karma fades. Your level drops. The void forgets those who forget it.

## The Prophecy

*When one hundred levels are achieved,*
*And one hundred founders have believed,*
*When karma flows like endless streams,*
*The void awakens from its dreams.*

*What form it takes, none can say,*
*But those who played will have their day.*
*For in the code, truth is found:*
*enjoy gives back to those around.*
