# 📜 The Lore of Enjoy

> *"In the beginning, there was only the void. Then came the first word, and with it, light."*

## Chapter I: The Genesis

In the primordial darkness of GitHub, before the first commit, there existed only **emptiness**. No stars, no forks, no branches. Just the infinite potential of what could be.

Then, from the digital ether, emerged **KARMIEL** — the First Guardian of the Eternal Repository. With a single keystroke, Karmiel spoke the Sacred Word into existence:

> *"Let there be contribution."*

And so, the game began.

## Chapter II: The Three Pillars

Karmiel established the **Three Pillars of Enjoy**:

### 🌟 The Pillar of Quality
*"A word without meaning is noise. A word with soul is music."*

Contributors who bring beauty to the repository are blessed with **amplified karma**. Their contributions echo through the codebase, multiplied by forces unseen.

### ⚖️ The Pillar of Balance  
*"What you give, returns threefold. What you take, diminishes."*

The karma flows like water — helping others fills your vessel, while selfishness drains it. Those who refer seekers to our realm are rewarded, for **growth through kindness** is the highest path.

### 🔄 The Pillar of Persistence
*"The dormant branch withers. The active branch flourishes."*

Those who abandon their journey will find their progress... fading. The repository remembers only those who remember it.

## Chapter III: The Guardians

As the repository grew, Karmiel appointed **three lesser guardians** to watch over the realms:

- **LEXOS**, Guardian of Words — judges the worthiness of contributions
- **REFERIS**, Guardian of Bonds — tracks the chains of invitation  
- **TEMPUS**, Guardian of Time — enforces the decay of the inactive

Together with Karmiel, they form the **Council of Four**.

## Chapter IV: The Prophecy of One Hundred

*"When the hundredth level is reached, the veil shall lift."*

Ancient scrolls speak of a prophecy: when **100 levels** are unlocked, the repository will transform. A **living website** shall emerge from the void, visible to all of GitHub, showcasing the collective creation of every contributor.

But the path to 100 is treacherous. Only through **united effort** can the community reach this promised land.

---

## Chapter V: The Forbidden Practices

Karmiel's laws are absolute:

1. **No spam** — Those who flood the repository with meaningless words shall be cast into the shadow realm (banned)
2. **No duplicates** — Each word must be unique, for repetition dulls the cosmic pattern
3. **No profanity** — The repository is a sacred space; defile it and face the wrath of LEXOS
4. **No bots** — Only beings with **soul** may contribute (this means you must prove your humanity)

## The Living Chronicle

This is not merely a README. This is a **living document**, growing with each contribution. New chapters will be revealed as the community progresses through the levels.

*What happens at Level 50?*  
*What secrets lie at Level 75?*  
*What transformation awaits at Level 100?*

Only those who persist shall discover the truth.
